        <Snippet title="HOW I STARTED">
          In 2023, I fell in love with startups. Not just the buzz, but the
          philosophy â€” speed, ownership, and relentless focus on user value. My
          north star has always been to create things that people want, and
          every project since 100xDevs has been another step toward that goal.

        <Snippet title="MY GOAL">
          creating a product so seamless you never notice it. something like a
          coffee cup, chair, street light, etc. something that provides value &
          is used so frequently it becomes a part of your life without
          questioning it.{" "}

          said &quot;the best design is invisible&quot;. i always think about
          that. probably something in tech/science.

        <Snippet title="MY MOTIVATIONS">
          i&apos;ve never really been driven by money. i read this on a fortune
          cookie from panda express a few years back. something like &quot;money
          is a means to an end, not the end itself&quot;. for now, i do it for
          the love of the game. i&apos;m always trying to be the best i can in
          everything i do. i&apos;ve been fortunate enough to never have to
          worry about food, money, housing, or education. so maybe this changes
          in the future. but i wasn&apos;t after fancy cars or nice watches like
          most people around my age. i think this mindset is becoming more
          common, but i&apos;d like to get to a point where i can live without
          having to worry about money. no mansion or private jet. i&apos;d just
          keep it simple.

          in 10 years, running a company or in vc. i move around a lot, so not
          sure if i&apos;d get the most value sticking to 1 thing for many
          years. i enjoy creating &amp; selling. maybe not going to college, so
          can&apos;t say for sure where i end up. i&apos;ve been hustling my
          whole life. im sure i&apos;ll figure something out.
